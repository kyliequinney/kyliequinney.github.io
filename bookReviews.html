                    <h3>Demon Copperhead</h3>
                    <small>By Barbara Kingsolver<br></small>
                    <!--<small>This fictional book follows the life of Damon (whose nickname is Demon). I'm not going to summarize the book because (1) I don't want to 
                        and (2) if you are going to read it, you should just dive in, a summary isn't necessary. As for my review, I think this may be my favorite 
                        book ever. This book has stuck with me so much more than any other book I have read recently. I am writing this review on 5/06/24 and I can say 
                        that I still think about this book. I literally wrote a journal entry about it after I finished it (I hardly ever journal) just because I NEEDED 
                        to get my thoughts down. Maybe I will eventually add that journal entry here, but for now it feels too personal (???).
                        So, for now, just know that this book is well worth the read.<br><br>

                    <h3>Allegedly</h3>
                    <small>By Tiffany D. Jackson<br></small>
                    <!--<small>Allegedly is about a girl who grows up in a correctional facility for most of her life due to a crime that she committed when she was 7. 
                        She ~allegedly~ murdered a baby that her mother was babysitting. I'll start off by saying I enjoyed reading this book, it went by quickly and 
                        it definitely had some suspenseful elements. That being said, I did think some parts seemed a bit unrealistic. 
                        For one, the main character is a black girl who was raised by her black mother. The baby that she ~allegedly~ 
                        murdered was white. Throughout the book, several news articles from the time of the murder are sprinkled in, and hardly any of them mention race. 
                        I found this to be pretty unrealistic, if this was to happen in real life, every single headline would be sure to mention that this was a black/African American girl 
                        who ~allegedly~ killed a white/caucasian baby. Every. Single. One. I had another issue with this book but I can't remember what it is anymore... 
                        Anyways, overall this was a good read, it was suspenseful, emotional and thought provoking.<br><br>

                    <h3>Mother Night</h3>
                    <small>By Kurt Vonnegut<br></small>
                    <!--<small>This book is written from the pov of Howard Campbell Jr, who is writing the the book while improsoned in Israel awaiting trial for his war crimes 
                        during WWII. Campbell had been a radio propagandist for the Nazi party, while at the same time working undercover for the US by transmitting 
                        secret messages to the Allies during his broadcasts. Campbell was told before taking the job that after the war, America would not let him hang, 
                        but they would also not publically admit to employing him as a spy. The book explores the idea of whether it is ok to do bad things if it is for a good reason. 
                        Campball's encrypted messages were invaluable to the Allies during the war, but his Nazi propaganda was invaluable to the German citizans and soldiers. There 
                        are some German's who told Campbell that he is what got them through the war, that he is the reason they kept going.<br><br>
